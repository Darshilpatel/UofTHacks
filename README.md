*Our project is designed to connect students, TAs, and professors so every student can get help when he/she needs it â€” even at 2AM. And to encourage students to help each other in a safe and fun environment. Some of the things that we may potentially incorporate in the future include, a points system as a sort of incentive to encourage students to answer more questions thereby helping more students learn more. *
